# PLANDSCAPES_2015

PLANDSCAPES 2015 revived

KIT
1) Sensors (arduino, ethernet shields)
2) electrodes (which one do we have?)
3) usb A to B arduino cables
4) Network Switch
5) Ethernet cables
6) Computer (IOS, Windows, Rasp)
7) Monitors


EXHIBITION

1) Plants with big and thick enough leaves to be able to take an electrode
2) Space to place the electronics around in safe, dry way
3) Prints - a hanging system to display a number of A3 prints

SETUP

1) install mosquitto on the minimac, follow this: https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/application-development/9781787287815/1/ch01lvl1sec12/installing-a-mosquitto-broker-on-macos.  
(you might need to install a homebrew https://brew.sh/ for this)

2) make sure it starts automatically

3) Downaload Vocabulary of Plants
4) Download libraries (and place it in the <i>libraries</i> folder of <i>Processing</i> folder - usually placed in <i>documents</i>)

5) SENSORS - one sensor can be connected to two plants (photo?). 
Then sensors are connected to switch, and switch to computer(s). 

Connect electrodes to the Arduino and shield (photo?), connect shield to the switch, put arduino on...
Do they need to get some ip addresses or whatever? 

6) run the processing sketch on each computer (are we actually having it as app or they just run fill screen sketch?)
wait for the first signal to see the visualisation

each visualisation will be saved as pdf in the folder ....
